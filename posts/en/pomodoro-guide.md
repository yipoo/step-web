# Complete Pomodoro Technique Guide

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple yet effective time management method. By breaking work into 25-minute focused sessions, you can significantly improve efficiency and concentration.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

Invented by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, the core concept is:

> **Break work into 25-minute focused intervals (one Pomodoro), with short breaks in between.**

### Basic Flow

1. **Choose a task** - Decide what to work on
2. **Set 25 minutes** - Start the Pomodoro timer
3. **Focus** - Work with full concentration, avoid all distractions
4. **Take a 5-minute break** - Rest briefly after timer ends
5. **Repeat** - After 4 Pomodoros, take a 15-30 minute break

## Why Does the Pomodoro Technique Work?

### 1. Combat Procrastination

25 minutes is manageable - less psychological pressure. "Just 25 minutes of focus" is easier to start than "Complete the entire project."

### 2. Maintain Focus

Clear time limits help the brain enter a focused state, reducing mind-wandering.

### 3. Prevent Overwork

Regular breaks prevent fatigue and maintain consistent high efficiency.

### 4. Quantify Time

Measure work in Pomodoros, making time investment visible.

## How to Use Pomodoro in Step?

### Start Timer

1. Select a todo task
2. Click the Pomodoro icon in task details
3. Click "Start" button
4. Focus for 25 minutes

### Estimate Pomodoros

Set estimated Pomodoro count for tasks:

```
Task: Complete project proposal
Estimated: 4 Pomodoros
Completed: 2/4
```

This helps you:
- More accurately estimate time
- Track actual vs. expected differences
- Optimize future time planning

### 1. Estimate Task Size

**Small Tasks (1-2 Pomodoros)**
- Reply emails
- Organize notes
- Quick meetings

**Medium Tasks (3-5 Pomodoros)**
- Write documents
- Code development
- Deep reading

**Large Tasks (6+ Pomodoros)**
- Complex projects
- Learn new skills
- Important reports

💡 **Tip**: Break large tasks into smaller ones.

### 2. Handle Interruptions

**Internal Interruptions** (Your thoughts)
- Quickly note them down
- Add to todo list
- Handle after Pomodoro ends

**External Interruptions** (Others)
- Politely say "I'll get back to you in 25 minutes"
- Exceptions for urgent matters
- Set focus time agreements

### 3. Optimize Breaks

**5-minute Short Break**
- Stand and walk
- Drink water
- Look out window
- Simple stretching

**15-30 minute Long Break**
- Take a walk
- Have a snack
- Relax and chat
- Meditate

❌ **Avoid**: Scrolling phone, watching videos (easy to exceed time)

### 4. Find Your Best Rhythm

Different people have different optimal rhythms:

**Standard Rhythm**
- 25 min work + 5 min break
- Suitable for most people

**Short Rhythm**
- 15 min work + 3 min break
- For beginners or difficulty concentrating

**Long Rhythm**
- 45 min work + 10 min break
- For experienced, highly focused individuals

💡 **Tip**: Start with standard rhythm, adjust based on feeling.

## Common Questions

### Q: What if task isn't finished in 25 minutes?

**A:** This is normal! Two approaches:

1. **Continue next Pomodoro** - For tasks needing more time
2. **Mark complete** - If almost done (within 5 minutes)

Important to record actual Pomodoros used for future estimates.

### Q: Must I do one task per Pomodoro?

**A:** Recommended to focus on one task. For very small tasks:

- Bundle multiple small tasks into one Pomodoro
- Example: Reply 3 emails + organize desk = 1 Pomodoro

### Q: Can I work during breaks?

**A:** Not recommended! Breaks are important:

- Let brain truly relax
- Prevent fatigue accumulation
- Maintain long-term efficiency

Skipping breaks reduces efficiency of subsequent Pomodoros.

### Q: Is Pomodoro suitable for all work?

**A:** Best for work requiring deep focus:

✅ **Suitable**
- Writing, coding, design
- Learning, reading, thinking
- Planning, analysis, summary

❌ **Less Suitable**
- Work requiring frequent communication
- Creative brainstorming (needs free time)
- Light administrative work

## Advanced Strategies

```
07:00 - 07:25  Deep work task 1
07:30 - 07:55  Deep work task 2
08:00 - 08:25  Plan today's todos
```

Advantages:
- Most energetic
- No interruptions
- Sets tone for the day

### 2. Themed Pomodoro Days

Set different themes each day:

- Monday: Creative planning (4 Pomodoros)
- Tuesday: Code development (6 Pomodoros)
- Wednesday: Learn new skills (4 Pomodoros)

### 3. Pomodoro Challenge

Set weekly/monthly goals:
