# Welcome to Step

> Every Step Counts

We're excited to announce the official launch of **Step**!

## Why We Created Step

In today's fast-paced world, we often:
- Set ambitious goals but struggle to maintain them
- Download countless productivity tools that end up unused
- Get caught up in "check-in" culture and lose sight of our original goals

**Step was born from a simple insight:**

> People don't fail because they lack goals, but because they lack an execution method that fits their own rhythm.

## Core Features

### 1. Smart Quick Add

Create todos instantly using natural language:

```
"Meeting at 3pm tomorrow important"
```

Automatically recognizes:
- ✅ Time: Tomorrow 15:00
- ✅ Priority: High
- ✅ Title: Meeting

### 2. Habit Tracking

Turn goals into habits:
- Daily runs 🏃‍♂️
- Weekly study sessions 📚
- Custom frequencies ⚙️

Streak counters and completion trends make your progress visible.

### 3. Pomodoro Focus

Integrated Pomodoro technique:
- 25-minute focus sessions 🍅
- Estimated tomatoes per task
- Focus time statistics

### 4. Data Visualization

Track growth with data:
- Daily/weekly task completion
- Completion rate trends
- Category time distribution
- Longest streak records
