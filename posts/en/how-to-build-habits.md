# How to Build Good Habits with Step

21 days to form a habit, 90 days to solidify it. You've probably heard this theory, but few people actually stick with it.

## Why Is It Hard to Persist?

1. **Lack of Tracking** - Don't know how long you've persisted
2. **No Feedback** - Can't see progress, easy to give up
3. **Too Idealistic** - Goals set too high, difficult to achieve

## How Step's Recurring Tasks Help You

### 1. Visualize Progress

Every check-in adds +1 to your streak. Watching the numbers grow is incredibly satisfying.

```
🔥 23-day streak
📈 This week: 6/7 completed
✨ Completion rate: 85%
```

### 2. Flexible Frequency Settings

Not all habits need to be daily:

- **Daily**: Morning run, meditation, reading
- **Weekdays**: Study, daily reports
- **Custom**: Gym on Tue/Thu/Sat

### 3. Gentle Reminders

Not harsh supervision, but gentle companionship:

> "Hey, you haven't checked in for your morning run today 🏃‍♂️"

## Real Case: My 30-Day Morning Run Plan

### Days 1-7: Building Foundation

- Goal: Run 30 minutes at 7 AM daily
- Strategy: Only 15 minutes for first 3 days, lower difficulty
- Check-in: 100%

### Days 8-14: Building Momentum

- After 7 consecutive days, body starts adapting
- Beginning to enjoy the running process
- Check-in: 100%

### Days 15-21: Forming Habit

- Not running actually feels uncomfortable
- Waking up early becomes easier
- Check-in: 100%

### Days 22-30: Solidifying Habit

- Morning run has become part of life
- Lost 3kg, full of energy
- Check-in: 100%

## 5 Tips to Increase Persistence

### 1. Start with Small Goals

❌ Run 10km every day  
✅ Run 1km daily (or walk 30 minutes)

### 2. Set Reminder Times

Set reminders when you're most likely to complete:

- Morning run: 7:00 AM
- Reading: 10:00 PM
- Study: 8:00 PM

### 3. Reward Yourself

- 7-day streak → Treat yourself to a good meal
- 14-day streak → Buy something you want
- 30-day streak → Take a day off

### 4. Don't Pursue Perfection

Occasional interruptions are okay, what matters is:

> Resume immediately after interruption.

### 5. Record Feelings

Record today's feelings in task notes:

```
✅ Morning run today
Feeling: Hard to get up, but great after running!
Weather: Cloudy, cool
```

## Data Speaks
